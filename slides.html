# Introduction to Git &amp; Github

---

# Git is hard to teach

- Git is _flexible_ supporting many **different workflows** (which means it's complicated)
- The commands have non-intuitive names and options.
- The benefits are long term<br />
    You probably would not use version control for an analysis that lasts two hours.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Set_of_security_screw_driver_bits.jpg)

## So, my request:

Suspend your skepticism for about an hour and then we can come back to it.

# What problems does version control solve?

"Piled Higher and Deeper" by Jorge Cham, http://www.phdcomics.com

---

# Why use version control?

- Making collaboration easier than "pass the baton"
- Traveling back in time to earlier versions of the project.

The issues above are also solved by Word "Track Changes", Google Docs automatic
revisions, or Dropbox's history.

- Allowing you to try things that can easily be rolled back.
- Keeping a version of record.
- Keeping separate branches.

### Where to use version control

- Code. Version control was made for code.
- Manuscripts
- Everything

Text-based files have built-in support, other types of files can also be used.

---

# Diffing

```bash
$ cat file1.txt
first line
second line
$ cat file2.txt
first line
third line
$ diff -u file1.txt file2.txt

# Git's model

- Works on a directory and all its subdirectories.

If we didn't have git, we could make a "poor man's git" in the following way:

- We take a directory for our project `project`.
- Every once in a while, we make a whole copy of the directory:

    1. `project_first_version_2016_08_22_8:14`
    2. `project_added_data_2016_08_22_11:27`
    3. `project_import_data_into_numpy_2016_08_22_15:22`
    4. `project_basic_stats_2016_08_22_17:01`
    5. `project_normalization_2016_08_23_9:53`
    6. ...

If you were very disciplined, this would actually work. You could then use diff
to compare versions.

This poor man's git is not so different from what git does (except git does it
in a smarter way than copying all the files).

---

# Exploring GitHub

Github is git + bells &amp; whistles

[https://github.com/tobyhodges/ITPP](https://github.com/tobyhodges/ITPP)


Let's look at
- History
- Diffs

For example,
[this diff](https://github.com/tobyhodges/ITPP/commit/7f765f1bd4149ba12d7927fa5bc0cfac68ba1f78)

---

# Using git: step 0

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
$ git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL (IF YOU WANT)"
$ git config --global color.ui "auto"
$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"
```

If you want another editor, naturally, you can set it there (including GUI editors).

---

# Using git: step 1

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tobyhodges/ITPP/
Cloning into 'ITPP'...
remote: Counting objects: 459, done.
remote: Total 459 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 459
Receiving objects: 100% (459/459), 2.88 MiB | 474.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (257/257), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

Git now _cloned_ the repository from github to a directory called `ITPP`.

Your copy is now **independent** of the original.

---

# Explore the cloned directory.

Let's explore the directory a bit:

```bash
$ cd ITPP
$ ls
```

---

# Looking at the history

```bash
$ git log
...
```

Same information as on the github website:

- Author
- Date
- Comment
- Funny IDs

---

# Remember the "poor man's git"?

What we have here is

1. the `project` directory (ITPP in this case)
2. inside a special `.git` folder, git is saving all the previous versions.


```bash
$ git diff 28c80e7299977392a3be6b00ad5be71cf3f46f8a
...
```

You can also use dates if you really want

```bash
$ git diff '@{2016-09-01 18:30:00}'
```

(This is just another example of git's flexibility over learnability).

---
# Going back in time

If you have a course that you taught several times, it's sometimes nice again
"the version I taught in September 2016"?

```bash
$ ls .ipynb_checkpoints
ls: cannot access '.ipynb_checkpoints': No such file or directory
$ git checkout 28c80e7299977392a3be6b00ad5be71cf3f46f8a
Note: checking out '28c80e7299977392a3be6b00ad5be71cf3f46f8a'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 28c80e7... merged Karin's changes to WS2 debugging exercise
$ ls .ipynb_checkpoints
2_BeginningProgramming-checkpoint.ipynb  3_InputAndOutputMPL-checkpoint.ipynb
```

---

# GUI Version

```bash
$ git-cola dag
```

You can do everything from `git-cola`, but I will use the command line version
as it's still the _least common denominator_.

---

# Making some changes

1. Let us go back to the latest version (which is called `master` by default):

```bash
$ git checkout master
```

2. Check the status

```bash
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

3.  Now, we make some changes

```bash
$ nano README.md
...
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
(use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

---
# Git diff

```bash
$ git diff

# Committing the changes

```bash
$ git add README.md

      modified:   README.md

---

# Staging

The "staging area" (aka. as "index") is another feature where git chose power
over learnability.

![](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/book/01-introduction/images/areas.png)

(From [git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics).)

---

# Commiting

```bash
$ git commit
...
```

Write your commit message.

--

## What are the advantages doing two steps (`add` and `commit`)?

- You can select bits and pieces to commit (even just parts of files)
- You can review your changes one last time (`git diff --staged`)

---
# Git commit options

Specifying the message inline

```bash
$ git commit -m "My commit message"
```

A good commit message will have a single, short, one line summary at the top,
then a blank line, then a longer explanation:

```
New analysis: diversity/temperature association

Plot the relationship between the diversity of a sample and the temperature of
the site.

As part of this commit, simplify the data loading code.
```

---

# Commit IDs

We have seen these bizarre commit-ids (e.g.,
`28c80e7299977392a3be6b00ad5be71cf3f46f8a`) show up in the log.

We can add a tag to a commit for convenience

```bash
$ git tag v1.0
```

Some names are magic

- `HEAD` is what we currently checked out.
- `HEAD~1` is the previous commit
- `master` is the most up to date commit.
---

---
# Throwing away changes

```bash
$ nano README.md
...
$ git diff
...
```

Imagine we do not like these changes. What do we do?

```bash
$ git checkout HEAD README.md
```

This checks out from `HEAD` only the file `README.md`.

--

**This is one of the few irreversible operations in git**.

**It's also _very useful_.**

- Let me check if this code is faster/better? If not, throw it away.
- Let me add some `print` statements to this code. When I found the bug, throw the `print`s away.
- Ooops, did I delete/overwrite some files I should not have? Get them back.

---
# Let's take a breath

We have seen

- `git clone`: we got a copy of the whole repository (including history)
- `git log`: a list of commits (which we also saw on github)
- `git checkout COMMIT_ID`: going back &amp; forward in history
- `git add`/`git commit`: Adding new commits
- `git tag`: add a tag to a commit

--

What we have not seen:

- how to start a git repository from scratch
- how to use git for collaboration
- branching and merging

We will not discuss:

- the other 99% of git options

---

# Starting from the other side

How do we *initialize* a new git repository?

```bash
$ mkdir git-notes-luispedro
$ cd git-notes-luispedro
$ git init
```

This transforms the current directory into a git repository (i.e., add the
`.git` directory and its magic files).

```bash
$ ls
...
$ ls -a
...
$ git status
...

```

**Git init does not add any files to the repository.**

---

# Adding files to our repository and committing.

We have seen this before.

```bash
$ nano basics.txt
...
$ git add basics.txt
$ git commit
...
```

---
# Starting with Github

Please go to [github.com](https://github.com) and get a new user account.

![](figures/green-post-it.png) Put up a green sticker once you have done so.

---
# Pushing your changes to Github

How do we tell git on our machine about this github thing?

We need to introduce a new concept: "remotes".

Fortunately, github is pretty good about helping out.


--

```bash
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/luispedro/git-notes-luispedro
...
```

We **add a remote** called _origin_ (just a convention) pointing to
https://github.com/luispedro/git-notes-luispedro

---
# Technical note on authentication

Please type

```bash
$ unset SSH_ASKPASS
```

and we will type out our username/password on the command line.

--

This works but is not the best way to do it. There is a solution (SSH keys),
but we will not cover it here. The github documentation explains it.


---

# Collaborating with git

I find git is even for single-user projects, but it becomes even more important
when working with others.

---

# Shared git repository

![](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/book/05-distributed-git/images/centralized_workflow.png)

---

# Sharing a repository

1. Pair up
2. Pick one of you to be the administrator (_Alice_)
3. The administrator should add the other member of the group (_Bob_) as a collaborator to their repository
4. _Bob_ should now clone from _Alice_'s repository

![](figures/green-post-it.png)
Once you get here, please put up a green sticker.

--

5. _Bob_ should now change something in the repository, `git add`, `git
   commit`, and finally call `git push`
--

6. Check that github now shows the newer changes
7. _Alice_ can now `git pull` the changes from github

![](figures/green-post-it.png)
Once you get here, please put up a green sticker.

---
# Merging &amp; conflicts

1.  _Alice_ clones from the repository (at version `X`) and makes a change (add a file named `alice.txt` describing your favorite food).
2.  _Bob_ clones from the repository (at version `X`)and makes a change (add a file named `bob.txt` describing your favorite food).

What happens when they want to push their changes back?

--

Whoever pushes first will change the repository on github.

```bash
$ git push
... OK
```

And the second person to push will get an error:

```bash
$ git push
To https://github.com/.....
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/vlad/planets.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull')
hint: before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

---
# Merging &amp; Conflicts

```bash
$ git pull
...
```

git _merged the changes_ and built a new directory which contains *both* Alice and Bob's changes.

--

This all happened locally (in Bob's computer). Bob can now push the merged changes to github:

```bash
$ git push
```

--

and Alice can pull:

```bash
$ git pull
```

Now, they are back in sync.

---
# Conflicts

What if git cannot merge?

1. _Alice_ edits `alice.txt` and `add`s, `commit`s and `push`es her changes.
2. _Bob_  edits `alice.txt` and `add`s, commit`s and `push`es his changes (**after** Alice).

_Bob_ will get the same non-fast-forward error and will try to `git pull` only
to see a conflict message!

```bash
[master 687aaf1] Bob's favorite drink
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  create mode 100644 bob.txt
  luispedro@rabbit:/tmp/t/git-notes-luispedro  §git pull

  remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.

     Auto-merging bob.txt
     CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in bob.txt
     Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

---
# Resolving conflicts

Git is not magic. If it cannot merge, it will ask _Bob_ to fix it.

```bash
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commit each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

    both added:      bob.txt
```

---
# You must manually fix the conflict

(_Alice_ should now work with _Bob_)

Edit `bob.txt`:

```bash
$ nano bob.txt
<<<<<<< HEAD
Bob likes mango lassi
=======
Bob likes gin & tonic
>>>>>>> 262601a49bdbc69f1dc65a558f80b97975f6f896
```

--
```bash
$ git add bob.txt
$ git commit
$ git push
```

Now look at how the repository looks like on github.

See `Graphs` tab and then `Network`.

---
# Pull requests

Git is extremely flexible and supports different workflows/code management
styles:

1. **Centralized**: a single master repository which people clone from/push to.
2. **Pull request**: only some users can commit to the main repository, others
   submit changes for approval (pull requests).

Note that git itself does not care about any of this: it's all "human level".

![](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/book/05-distributed-git/images/integration-manager.png)

---

# The PR model

The pull request model (in general):

1. I publish my repository
2. You make your changes publicly available
3. You ask (request) that I **pull** from your repository

You can do this the old fashioned way, with email, but it's much easier with github.

--

4. _Alice_ should _fork_ _Bob_'s repository on github.
5. _Alice_ should clone from **her fork** to her computer.

---
# Mixed centralized/pull request model

You can mix centralized and PR management in the same project.
--

It sounds very abstract, but here is a realistic situation where it is _very
natural_ to have a mixed centralized/PR model:

> You start a project with your lab mates and put it on github. Since it's just
> 3 of you, you work in the centralized model, using a lab github page as the
> centre.
>
> Later, you make the repository public and others start forking and submitting
> PRs.
>
> Your small team (the core developers) may still prefer to work in the
> centralized model, but you might not want to give others on the outside
> access.

Probably **most open source software** works like this.

---

# Integrate git(hub) with other functionality

- Github pages
- External
- ...

There are many services built around git.

---

# Git based services

We showed off github as it's the most widely used service, but there are
others:

1. Github
2. Gitlab
3. Bitbucket

These are all fairly similar. Github typically requires you to get a paid plan
to have private repositories (i.e., not open source), but you can also ask for
an educational acccount.

---
# A few remarks on software licenses

If you make your code public, then you should explicitly add a license.

<style>
DT { font-weight: bold; }
DD { padding-bottom: 1em; }
</style>
<dl>
<dt>Default (if you say nothing)</dt>
<dd>All rights reserved.<br />
In copyright law, the creator retains all rights to their creation unless they give/sell them away.<br />
Technically, nobody can do anything with your code.
</dd>

<dt>GPL/Copyleft</dt>
<dd>Share alike</dd>

<dt>BSD/MIT</dt>
<dd>Very free</dd>
</dl>

Obviously, IANAL.

The equivalent for non-code (text, images, &amp;c) is the [Creative
commons](https://creativecommons.org/) family of licenses.

---
# What we left out (the other 99%)

We can have long discussions on how to organize branches.

There are several advanced git commands that allow you to rewrite history, undo
mistakes, and perform advanced branch manipulations.
